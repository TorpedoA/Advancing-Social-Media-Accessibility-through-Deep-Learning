# Advancing Social Media Accessibility through Deep Learning

This project is aimed to enhance social media accessibility for visually impaired users by utilizing deep learning models VGG-16, ResNet-34, MobileNet, and DenseNet-121 for image classification. We have used Imaganette dataset which is a subset of ImageNet dataset, as it is more suitable for rapid testing of different algorithms.

This repository contains a pdf file named "final_project.pdf" containing the detailed description of the project. The Code folder contains a jupyter notebook which contains all the necessary code.
